		<p class="pageName">CVV and AVS checks</p>
		<p>As of November 2012 Stripe can sometimes return a successful payment combined with a CVV/AVS failure or unchecked status. Rather than have these orders go through with whichever status you have selected for successful ones 
		I have coded in some new order statuses that you may use if you wish - it's up to you but, particularly with downloadable products, I would exercise some care here and read up on how Stripe handles these.<p>More infomation on this at: <a href="https://answers.stripe.com/questions/cvc-status-unchecked" target="_parent">Stripe</a>		
		<p class="pageName">Saved cards - customer and card objects</p>
		<p> A quick Stripe 101 here - Stripe works in a couple of ways - you can simply create a 'card object' for each sale and leave it at that. Alternatively you  can create a 'customer object' and attach a 'card object' to that customer for their first purchase. After that you can just charge the customer object - that's how this module is set up.<br />
		You can modify the card object attached to a customer but you cannot replace it with an empty value - if a customer no longer wants to have any card attached to his object then you have to delete the customer object.
		All very confusing but that's how it works at the moment - more info <a href="https://answers.stripe.com/questions/how-do-you-clear-or-delete-the-customer-object-s-active-card" target="_blank">here</a>.
		<br />
		<br />
		Don't confuse this with a customer record in your store though - the two are unlinked entities so deleting the customer object at Stripe does not have any affect on the customer account in Zen Cart<br />
		<br />
		I have decided not to give customers control of Stripe cards/accounts other than through the final checkout page (i.e. they can change/delete a card only in conjunction with a sale) as there may be a future point where a store has a customer linked up to a recurring payment via Stripe - if we allow a customer to remove a card under those circumstances then it could lead to a loss for the store. (likewise I have provided the admin option of NOT allowing customers to opt out of saving their card at Stripe for scenarios like recurring payments)<br />
		<br />
		It is always open for customers to opt out of saving a card/asking the store owner to unlink it at Stripe
		<p class="pageName">v1.1 Update		
		<p>Added in another option - you can now decide whether to use Stripe as a simple card processor (i.e. every transaction goes through as a card object) or setup Customer Objects.<br />
